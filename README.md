Skip & Cal
==========

This repository contains the source code for the app that used to power [skipandcal.net](http://skipandcal.net), a web repository of my cartoons and comics. (As of 2019, the site instead runs on static pages derived from this app.)

This website uses the [Ruby on Rails 3.2](http://rubyonrails.org/) web development framework and the [ZURB Foundation 2](http://foundation.zurb.com/) web design framework. The site itself is happily hosted on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/).

Feel free to make use of the code as you see fit (except to hack the site).
